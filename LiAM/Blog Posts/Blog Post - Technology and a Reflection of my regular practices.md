My year of regulating consumption.

Tech that's helpful in my life, now:
- Pocket
- Podcasts
	- the app of choice
		- PocketCast
			- quality of life stuff
				- the basics - new podcasts are automatically download, and a running queue is maintained
				- NOTE: queues are a theme of my workflow. I find that they dramatically reduce wasted time on platforms, and keep my focuses since I don't have to sift through piles of junk on "for you" and "recommended" pages. I am a firm believer that if you curate a list of creators to follow, and keep it generally a manageable size, it's a much better use of time than the traditional "timeline" algorithmic solution.
	- the lists
		- S Tier: ![[Screenshot 2024-01-01 at 14.33.49.png]]
		- this is what I've found is my 'manageable' list of hosts/shows. I generally try to avoid using the term "creator" because it's too broad, and I've been trying to be "specific with my words "**JBP rule here**
		- some of these shows need no introduction, but nonetheless I'll list them with a personal comment below:
			- *Lex Fridman Podcast*: a long-format discussion, sometimes about technology, but also frequently about current events. Recent guests include: Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and George Hotz
			- *WAVEFORM*: the podcast hosted and produce by MKBHD and his team, and which generally covers consumer technology
			- *The Ben Shapiro Show*: The only strictly political show on this list, Ben and his team at the Daily Wire produce this show daily, which has been my go-to for current events for years. I think I discovered the guy back in mid-2019.
			- *The Darkhorse Podcast*: Host by the couple, doctors Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying are former biology professors, and their background in evolutionary biology specific bring helpful explanations to some modern problems.
			- *Chris Williamson*: The newest addition to the list, Chris Williamson is a US immigrant who brings a fresh and curious voice to the world of long-format shows. His discussions aren't particularly technical, but rather easy to digest, and I'm inspired by his ability to ask smart questions.
			- *Honestly with Bari Weiss*: I don't know much about Bari herself but I think I heard her name for the first time a year or two ago, likely as a guest on another one of these shows. She brings a liberal perspective to current issues and I've come to really appreciate the balance. It's helped me realize that there are things I can agree with liberals about, as far as values and a common good. I do also distinguish liberal from leftist.
			- *Huberman Labs*: This show has really picked up steam; it's on the Top 25 Spotify podcasts ([#6 in the U.S, and #3 globally,]([source](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/spotify-top-podcasts-2023-list-joe-rogan-deal-renewal-1235809680/))) and also one of those that I hear about in real life (the upstate-NY running community, most recently.) In terms of the information that's discussed, it has one of the high quality-to-quantity ratios of any show on this list.
			- Unlisted: *The Joe Rogan Experience* 
				- The JRE isn't pictured above because it's a Spotify exclusive (and thus the only podcast I don't listen to on Pocketcast) The legendary show needs no introduction, especially after another 1st-place ranking on Spotify charts, and landing a $200M exclusive deal with Spotify a couple of years ago.

				- reference Huberman saying Rogan's done great things to allow drive interest in health
					- find either Obsidian note or tweet about it
			- I created a podcast notes template **which I will share here** for when I'm home and listening, and specifically want to retain or be more engaged with the show

- [[YouTube]]
	- specifically, when curated
		- block dumb channels, hide Shorts, and pull videos mainly from the Subscription tab
	- go through, count the number of subscriptions, and bucket them into technical, entertainment, and other


Being a power-user (of tech in general):
- what do I use to my advantage?
- tasks automations:
	- macOS boot-up updates and checks
		- Automator calls a custom Python file to update software on boot
	- funny voice-assistant-dialog
		- mac says "Hey Google, good morning"
		- my Pixel or Google Home mini executes its morning routine (for which the trigger is the "good morning" phrase)
			- this routine announces information like:
				- reads the daily weather
				- tells me about my work commute
				- reads off my day's calendar
				- starts my podcast of choice, which I would have configured in the Home app in advance
					- most likely, it's one of my S-tier podcasts from my Pocketcast list
