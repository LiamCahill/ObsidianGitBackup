|I met Fareena today. She's a girl that I've seen a couple of occasions in Stacks, always as a good fashion sense, and who I'm pretty sure drives a white BMW 5 series. I think we exchanged a few words in the past, maybe about the wifi password, or maybe I asked her to watch my stuff while I used the restroom once.|

|3|- Anyways, she came in today, and we exchanged a few more words.|
|4|-|
|5|- I started off the main conversation asking, "Do you come here much?" Moments later, I asked, "Can I buy you coffee sometime?" and also, "could I get your number."|
|6|-|
|7|- She entered it into my phone herself, and then also added her name. I'm guessing she's had practice with this...|
|8|-|
|9|- We talked for several minutes, about a handful of items.|
|10|-|
|11|- Things she mentioned:|
|12|- - she likes to drive|
|13|- - there's good coffee up in Saratoga|
|14|- - she had/has a final for a Master's class she's doing at UAlbany|
|15|- - lives upstairs, above Stacks|
|16|- - has a brother, a freshman at RPI|
|17|-|
|18|- When I made it back to my apartment, I spent the better part of 30 minutes drafting a 3-sentence message. I purposely didn't do any internet recon, and sent something to the effect of, "Nice to meet you earlier. Would grabbing coffee sometime next week work for you?"|
|19|-|
|20|- Only after the message was sent (moments before writing this) did I take to a brief session of Googling...maybe it was a dumb move.|
|21|-|
|22|- When she said, I went to school up in New Hampshire, I took it casually. I didn't think it'd be Dartmouth. I didn't think she meant she had several degrees.|
|23|-|
|24|- Now I feel intimidated by 1. her beauty, and 2. her education/accreditation.|
|25|-|
|26|- Accreditations intimidate me because I know that, statistically, women prefer men who are at least equal to them in terms of intelligence. Using standardized testing and diplomas from top universities as a marker for her intelligence, I would say I'm considerably out-classed, and thus going up to bat with one automatic strike.|
|27|-|
|28|- As a separate matter, she mentioned that she works for Senator Kirsten Gillabrand. Gillabrand is the Democratic Senator from Albany. Now, I know very little about her record or if Fareena completely aligns with her, to be fair. But it brings immediate concerns to my mind, as I question if that's already a nail in the coffin, in terms of Fareena and I being in agreement about politics.|

|30|- ______|
|31|- Did I break one of the unspoken rules of the modern dating world?|
|32|- Did I message her too quickly?|
|33|- Is there no leeway for making a 'mistake' like that?|
|34|- What the hell.|
|35|-|

|39|- ### Text Message Draft #2 - A final attempt|
|40|- Hey Fareena, hope you had good weekend. Just wanted to let you know that Tuesday and Wednesday aren't good for me anymore, but I'd still be interested in buying you a coffee if you're free Thursday.|
