I met Fareena today. She's a girl that I've seen a couple of occasions in Stacks, always as a good fashion sense, and who I'm pretty sure drives a white BMW 5 series. I think we exchanged a few words in the past, maybe about the wifi password, or maybe I asked her to watch my stuff while I used the restroom once. 

Anyways, she came in today, and we exchanged a few more words. 

I started off the main conversation asking, "Do you come here much?" Moments later, I asked, "Can I buy you coffee sometime?" and also, "could I get your number."

She entered it into my phone herself, and then also added her name. I'm guessing she's had practice with this...

We talked for several minutes, about a handful of items. 

Things she mentioned:
- she likes to drive
- there's good coffee up in Saratoga
- she had/has a final for a Master's class she's doing at UAlbany
- lives upstairs, above Stacks
- has a brother, a freshman at RPI

When I made it back to my apartment, I spent the better part of 30 minutes drafting a 3-sentence message. I purposely didn't do any internet recon, and sent something to the effect of, "Nice to meet you earlier. Would grabbing coffee sometime next week work for you?"

Only after the message was sent (moments before writing this) did I take to a brief session of Googling...maybe it was a dumb move.

When she said, I went to school up in New Hampshire, I took it casually. I didn't think it'd be Dartmouth. I didn't think she meant she had several degrees.

Now I feel intimidated by 1. her beauty, and 2. her education/accreditation.

Accreditations intimidate me because I know that, statistically, women prefer men who are at least equal to them in terms of intelligence. Using standardized testing and diplomas from top universities as a marker for her intelligence, I would say I'm considerably out-classed, and thus going up to bat with one automatic strike.

As a separate matter, she mentioned that she works for Senator Kirsten Gillabrand. Gillabrand is the Democratic Senator from Albany. Now, I know very little about her record or if Fareena completely aligns with her, to be fair. But it brings immediate concerns to my mind, as I question if that's already a nail in the coffin, in terms of Fareena and I being in agreement about politics.

Did I break one of the unspoken rules of the modern dating world? 
Did I message her too quickly? 
Is there no leeway for making a 'mistake' like that?
What the hell.
