###Do not send###


Made it on-board my flight to CO.

I was having a bit of a sad evening yesterday, just in one of my funks I guess. So, I really appreciated you stopping by with coffee this morning to talk about it; that was very nice of you, and really helped my day get off to a great start. I still don't perfectly understand how people manage to cope with their insecurities, and that's been particularly challeneging for me.
