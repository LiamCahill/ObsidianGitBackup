#obsidian #obsidiangit #github #githubtoken #bluetoothfiletransfer
I was updating my Github token today, from my MBP. I also needed to update it on mobile.
So, I saved it to a .txt file, connected via bluetooth from phone to MBP, and launched the Bluetooth File Exchange. From mobile, I used Temux, cat'ed the file once the transfer was accepted, and the simply pasted it with Obsidian prompted.
