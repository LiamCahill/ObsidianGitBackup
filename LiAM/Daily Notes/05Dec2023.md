Imagine a daily report that presents the weather, and my run for the day +tomorrow's too. Maybe it's emailed to me. Maybe it also includes the newest podcasts of the week, to remind me to listen, too. 

To myself: Would others find that useful, too? Is there something else I could add so that they might? What do other people want in a daily morning report? What do other daily morning reports have?
