Email points to American Eagle:
- I'm in the process of trying to register my car in the state of NY. The title I received after my lease buyout is a CT title. I'm assuming this was issued because I was living in CT at the time of purchase. However, when bringing it to the New York DMV, I am told that I need to pay sales tax on the vehicle again. The title lists me as the owner, but at my previous CT-based address.
- Is this consistent with what you would expect? I'm trying to avoid paying sales tax for two state. Do you know if it's possible to get an updated title for the NY DMV listing my current address? 
- Does American Eagle need to be listed as the lien holder on the new title?



Questions to NY DMV:
- what would happen if I didn't have my title?
- say you are not the owner
