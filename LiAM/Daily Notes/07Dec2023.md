I grew up being used to being social and friendly with both boys and girls my age. Then in high school I was hardly social with any girls but it didn't bother me because I thought it would get better.
Then I went to college and was considerably better at socializing with boys and girls again. But also much much more self-conscious
What that interaction at college didn't prepare me for? Was all of the stark rejection either explicitly or through lack of response from other women my age.

When I meet a girl at a coffee shop ask her if I can buy her a latte sometime and then ask for her phone number. It gets my hopes up that I might actually get a response. 

It's so miserable only getting rejections.

So I think I'll be playing video games tonight to distract myself from it.

The penalty for trying is just as bad as the cost of not playing the game in the first place. So why even try?
