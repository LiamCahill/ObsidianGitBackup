Write a Twitter post about my favorite and least favorite socially acceptable uses of technology.

Least favorites probably include:
- short form video
- a lack of any value in photographs because they can be produced with such little cost and can also be fabricated now
- the world of zero attention span and constant marketing
-    I frequently make the choice to pay for ad removal in part because it clearly helps to retain attention and keep me focused when I'm consuming something


Things that I like
- long format podcasts

YouTube reflection

I should go through and look at the last 100 YouTube videos. I watched and rank them and then arranged them by junk and things I'm glad I watched

We need to decouple taking pictures with being active on social media. That's a thought from the Chris Williams and episode about why no one can think rationally anymore

Scenario:
A cop is sitting in a traffic. Stop with his radar. He has fixed a speed to his system that will flag anyone for going over x amount. Should he avoid looking at any cars or drivers forsake of being completely unbiased? Should he be blind to any and all individual characteristics?
