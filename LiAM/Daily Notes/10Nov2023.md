Being rejected sucks.

It's really discouraging not hearing anything back from Elsie. 

I think this makes it the fourth or 5th girl I've reached out to and got no rejection from this year.

It's also so hard to think that some people still think dating is fun. There must be something wrong with me.

I mean, why should I expect that people even care to respond anymore when reaching out virtually?

All this rejection makes me want to drive harder into the isolationist single life out of frustration and spite. It's clearly not just one person that's rejecting me and that suggests that it's not the group. That's the issue. It's me. 

What should the creative goal be? To get more rejections? Otherwise how do you justify asking?
