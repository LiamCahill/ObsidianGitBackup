#### General Notes
Right, no pain. I did 15 minutes on the elliptical, 25 on the erg, and 30 running. ðŸ™‚ 
It doesn't seem my like my problem is quite my Achilles - I think it's the muscle that runs on the inside of my leg, along my shin. It's something that gave me issues a few years ago, so I started doing the PT exercises for that, again. I massaged and iced it yesterday and had no pain this morning. If I had to guess, I bet it's related to big toe and glute stuff. 
Just finished icing again. Going to see how it feels tomorrow. If it's still good, I'll make it out again (but slower.)
