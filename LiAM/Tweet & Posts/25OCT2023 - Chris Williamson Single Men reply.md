"45% of men have never approached a woman in person." 

From what I've seen and experienced, this makes sense.  There's a disconnect between men's expectations for how easy it is to find partners( in terms of effort,) and the reality of the situation.

Ok. How about for the other 55% that have, but are actually experiencing rejection, whether explicitly or implicitly when the phone number they were given doesn't reply, for example?

In my case, I've asked 3 women out this year. Two explicitly said no, one gave me a phone number but never replied.

Three is more than I've ever asked in year, and probably more than I've asked in my first 27 years of life, combined.

What is an acceptable success rate? Fail rate? I guess we just keep trying until we get a 'bite.' Otherwise, we'll just keep running out of time.
